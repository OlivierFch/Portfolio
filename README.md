# Portfolio

This project is for me a way to present all the accomplished projects as well as to learn the angular JS framework.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.4.
